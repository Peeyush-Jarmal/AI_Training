Animals are living organisms that belong to the biological kingdom Animalia. 
They are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that typically consume organic material, 
breathe oxygen, and are capable of movement at some stage of their life.

Animals are broadly classified into vertebrates and invertebrates. 
Vertebrates include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, all of which have a backbone.
Invertebrates, such as insects, worms, and mollusks, do not have a backbone.

Mammals are warm-blooded animals that usually have hair or fur and produce milk to feed their young.
Examples of mammals include humans, elephants, whales, dogs, and bats.

Animals play a crucial role in ecosystems. 
They help maintain ecological balance through activities such as pollination, seed dispersal, and predation.
