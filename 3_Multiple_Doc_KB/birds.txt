Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrate animals belonging to the class Aves.
They are characterized by feathers, beaks without teeth, lightweight skeletons, and the ability to lay eggs.

Most birds can fly, although some species such as ostriches, penguins, and emus are flightless.
Birds use their wings primarily for flying, but also for balance, courtship displays, and protection.

Birds have a high metabolic rate and a strong heart, which supports the energy demands of flight.
Their respiratory system is highly efficient and includes air sacs that allow continuous airflow through the lungs.

Birds are found on every continent and in almost every habitat, from forests and deserts to oceans and polar regions.
