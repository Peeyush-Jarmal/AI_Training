Migration is the seasonal movement of animals from one region to another.
It is commonly observed in birds, but many mammals, fish, and insects also migrate.

Bird migration usually occurs to find better feeding grounds, suitable breeding locations,
or more favorable climate conditions.
Some birds travel thousands of kilometers during migration.

Examples of migratory birds include Arctic terns, swallows, and geese.
The Arctic tern is known for having one of the longest migration routes in the animal kingdom.

Migration is guided by environmental cues such as daylight length, temperature changes,
and the Earth's magnetic field.
